# To activate an addon, uncomment the Makefile for the addon here.
#
# Then, make clean and make.
#
# Addons are divided into four classes:
#  Libraries are the protocol libraries sold with QualNet
#  Interfaces are external interfaces requiring third party s/w.
#  Addons are usually temporary code or custom code not for sale
#  Contributed models are given to us by customers for distribution.
